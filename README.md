## About me
I am Pan Jing Bin, a masters by research student at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I currently work as a research assistant under [Subhro Ghosh] (https://subhro-ghosh.github.io/). Previously, I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from NUS as well.

## Research

My interests lie in statistics and probability. My recent work focus on statistical estimation in the multi-reference alignment model. I am currently working on the problem of nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation in mixture models.
