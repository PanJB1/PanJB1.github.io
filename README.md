## About me
I am Jing Bin Pan, a masters by research student at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I currently work as a research assistant under [Subhro Ghosh](https://subhro-ghosh.github.io/). Previously, I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from NUS as well. Here is my [CV](/CV.pdf). Here is my [portfolio](https://panjb1.github.io/Portfolio/).

## Research

My interests lie in statistics and probability. My recent work focus on statistical estimation in the multi-reference alignment model. I am currently working on the problem of nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation in mixture models.

## Preprints
## Minimax-optimal estimation for sparse multi-reference alignment with collision-free signals [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07839), 
with Subhro. Ghosh, S.S. Mukherjee.
